A02 - Cryptographic Failures - Sample Commands
==============================================

Note: A02 is a demonstration class, not a web API.
Run: python A02_Example_Cryptographic_Failures.py

This example demonstrates weak cryptographic implementations in code:
- MD5 password hashing (easily crackable)
- Weak XOR encryption with fixed key
- Caesar cipher for "secure" communication
- Hardcoded encryption keys
- Unencrypted HTTP transmission

No curl commands needed - run the Python script directly to see the vulnerabilities.

# Vulnerability: Weak cryptographic algorithms and poor key management
# Impact: Passwords can be cracked, encrypted data can be decrypted, communications intercepted
